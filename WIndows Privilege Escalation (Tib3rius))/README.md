#Windows Privilege Escalation


## 1.  Setup

1. download/use the tools provided , to kali machine
2. start the smb server in kali (make sure to start in tools folder)
```bash
â”€$ sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py tools .
[sudo] password for kali:

```
3. [Log in as : `IEUser`]In windows machine open Powershell(run as administartor)
4. start the smb server 

    ```powershell
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -Featurename "SMBProtocol-Client" -All
    
    ```

4a. if the above command does'nt work(in my case) use:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32>Get-WIndowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "SMB1Protocol"
```


5. Turn on optional feature by typing `optionalfeatures.exe` in powershell.
6. Enable `SMB File Sharing Support` and `SMB Direct`.
7. Restart the machine.
8. Login as IEuser and run cmd as administrator and `cd` to `Desktop`
9. copy the setup script from kali smb server

```powershell
    copy \\192.168.37.128\tools\setup.bat .
```
10. Run the setup.bat
```powershell
   .\setup.bat
```
11. Restart windows (you will see new account and PrivEsc folder in `C`): Login as User `user`  with password `password321`




## 2. Accounts on Windows Machine

IEUser - Password - `Passw0rd!`  
admin- `password123`  
user - `password321`

## 3. Privilege Escalation in Windows 

- Privilege Escalation can be simple (e.g. a kernel exploit) or requires a lot of reconnaissance on the compromised system.

- In a lot of cases, privilege escalation may not simply rely on a single misconfiguration, but may require you to think, and combine multiple misconfigurations.

- All privilege escalations are effctively examples of access control violations.
- Access control and user permissions are intriniscally linked.
- When focusing on privilege escalations in Windows, understanding how Windows handles permissions is very important.

### 3.1 Understanding Permissions in Windows


**User Accounts**  
- User accounts are used to log into windows sysrtem.
- think of a user account as a collection of settings/preferences bound to a unique identity.
- The local `administrator` account is created by default at installation.
- Several other default user accounts may exist (e.g. `Guest`) depennding on ther version of windows. 

**Service Accounts**

- Service accounts are(somewhat obviously) used to run services in windows.
- Service accounts cannot be used to sign into a windows system.
- The ***System*** account is a default service account which has the highest privileges of any local account in windows.
- Other default service accounts include ***NETWORK SERVICE*** and ***LOCAL SERVICE***


**Groups**  
- User accounts can belong to multiple Groups, and Groups can have multiple users.Groups can even belong to other Groups.
- Groups allow for easier access control to resources, by setting up group wide permissions to all members of the group, rather than having to set the permissions individually.
- Regular groups(e.g. Administrators, Users) have a set list of members.
- Pseudo groups(e.g. "Authentication Users") have a dynamic list of members which changes based on certain ineteractions.  


**Resources**  
- In Windows, there are multiple type of resources(also known as objects):
    - Files/Directories
    - Registry entries
    - Services
- Whether a user and/or group has permission to perform a certain action on a resource depend on that resources's access control list(ACL).


**ACLs & ACEs**  
- Permissions to access a certain resource in windows are controlled by the access control list(ACL) for that resource.
- Each ACL is made up of zero or more access control entries(ACEs).
- Each ACE defines the relationship between a principle(e.g. a user, group) and a certain access right.
