static analysis can't detect whether software requirements have been fulfilled or how a function will execute. 

You'll need dynamic testing for that. That's why static analysis and dynamic testing are complementary. Static analysis detects bugs in code early on.

The fundamental disadvantage of static analysis is that it produces numerous false positives (warnings that do not actually involve vulnerabilities)

SAST leads to the following problems:
Manual effort
Time-consuming
Lack of securit



What Static Analysis Can Find
Static analysis finds potential quality issues in your code before you run your program.

This includes:

Programming errors
Coding standard violations
Security weaknesses




The Disadvantages of Static Code Analysis
Static analysis tools rely on abstract models and representations of program data flows and logic, which leads to a relatively large proportion of false positives in the results.

 source code analysis can’t catch runtime and configuration errors.


For web applications that use third-party libraries dynamically loaded from static code, dynamic analysis is the only feasible approach to ensuring security.
