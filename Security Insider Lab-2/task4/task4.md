### Exercise 1: Kernel features
__a) What is your current kernel version? and which kind of security mechanisms does it support to prevent or to mitigate the risk of stack-based buffer overflow exploits?__
__Solution :__ 
- To check your kernal version use command `uname -a`
  
 - ![img](../task4/images/kernal_version.JPG)
 - It supports 
   - ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization, Random assignment of Addresses like heap, stack, libraries, main excecutable.
   - Data execution prevention ( NX never execute )
   - Stack Canaries 
  
__b) Briefly explain how you can disable or circumvent these techniques.?__
__Solution :__ 
- To disable ASLR
  - ```sudo bash -c 'echo "kernel.randomize_va_space = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'```
- To disable Data execution prevention add the following command to your compiling argument 
  - `-z execstack`
- To disable Stack Canaries add the following command to your compiling argument  
  - `-fno-stack-protector`

### Exercise 2: GNU Debugger - Helpful commands

__1) Compile the C program example1.c with gcc the GNU Compiler Collection (or clang) using
the command line : gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -ggdb
Explain briefly why we used these options?__ 
- Compile and run
  
![img](../task4/images/compile_2_1.JPG)

- `-m32` : to generate a 32 bit binary.
- `-fno-stack-protector` : disable the stack canaries
- `-z execstack` : to disable Data execution prevention so that the content in stack can be executed.
- `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2` would align the stack by 4 bytes so that it becomes more consistent and easier to exploit.
- `ggdb`:  produces debugging information specifically intended for **gdb**

__2) Load the program in gdb and run it. Indicate how you achieved this.__

![img](../task4/images/run_and_load.JPG)

- Using the script [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) with gdb.
  
__3)  Set a break point at the function `mult()`.__

![img](../task4/images/b_mult.JPG)

__4) Set a break point at a specific position within this function.__

- To set a break point at 10th instruction of mult()

![img](../task4/images/b_mult_f.JPG)

__5) List the source code at the positions you set the breakpoints.__

![img](../task4/images/list_code.JPG)

__6) List all breakpoints you set so far..__

![img](../task4/images/list_break.JPG)

__7) Delete the second break point.__

![img](../task4/images/delete_2.JPG)
__8) Run the program and print the local variables after the program has entered mult() for the
first time. Explain your results.__

![img](../task4/images/locals.JPG)

- Garbage values are stored in local variables before initialization.

__9) Print the content of one single variable.__

![img](../task4/images/print_single.JPG)
__10) Print the content of the variables of interest during the execution of the for-loop in
mult().(three iterations only!)__

![img](../task4/images/duringex2.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/duringex3.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/duringex4.JPG)

__11) Set a new break point at printHello() and execute the program until it reaches this break
point without stepping through every single line of your source code.__
![img](../task4/images/printhello.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/printhello1.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/printhello2.JPG)

__12) Print the local variable i in binary format.__
![img](../task4/images/binary.JPG)
__13) Print the last byte of the local variable i in binary format.__
![img](../task4/images/binary_last.JPG)
__14) Print the first five characters of the local variable hello in character format.__
![img](../task4/images/hellohex.JPG)
__15). Print the content of the local variable hello in hex format.__
![img](../task4/images/hellohex1.JPG)

### Exercise 3: GNU Debugger - Simple program manipulation

__1) Change the values of i and hello before the printf command in printHello() is executed (check your changes by printing the variables with commands of gdb).__

![img](../task4/images/3_1.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/3_1.1.JPG)

__2) Change one single character within the string hello to hallo (assigning a new string differing in one character is not accepted here).__

![img](../task4/images/3_2.JPG)

__3) Display the address of printf and try to list the source code at this address. Explain your results and repeat this task with the printHello() function__

![img](../task4/images/3_3.JPG)

- printf is an external function so it didnt list the source code like the printHello (internal function of program).

__4) Use the info command to find out more about the current stack frame.__

![img](../task4/images/3_4.JPG)

__5) Display registers and stack__

![img](../task4/images/3_5.JPG)
**pending**
 ### Exercise 4: Simple buffer overflow - Overwrite local variables

 __1) Shortly explain in your own words, why this program is vulnerable.__
 - The program is vulnerable because it reads user input till it receives EOF and there is no check on input size which will be stored bufferâ€™s size. If the user input size is greater than buffer size, buffer overflow occours.

__2) show attack__

![img](../task4/images/4_2.JPG)

__3) Show a memory layout of the main stack frame, before and after the exploit (draw and explain it).__

- **to do**

__4) Why is this exploit possible and how could a developer have prevented it?__

```c 
  void readInput(char *buf) {
   int offset = 0;
   int ch = 0;
   while((ch = getchar()) != EOF && offset < 20) {
    \\ offset limit can also set dynamically
    buf[offset++] = (char)ch;
   }
  }
```
![img](../task4/images/4_4.JPG)

### Exercise 5: Buffer overflows - Overwrite function pointers

__1) Briefly describe the normal behavior of this program and explain why this program is
vulnerable.__
 - The program expects two cmd line arugments, arg1 will be copied into buffer and arg2 length is checked and passed to **fctPtr** if length is greater than 1 and **fctPtr** points to **printStr** function else points to **printChar**.
 - This program is vulnerable because the arg1 is copied into the stack without checking if the size is less than buffer, can overflow stack and can manuplate what fctPtr points. 

__2) Indicate the input to this program and the tools you used to successfully exploit the program__

![img](../task4/images/5_2.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/5_2.1.JPG)

__3) Together with your input, outline the stack content before (this is, shortly before your input
manipulates the future program behavior) and after the exploit__

__4) Describe the irregular control flow your input induced (next instruction executed and why).__
the control flow is if the argument2 length is not greater than 1 then i should print Char : a but its pointing to **printStr** so printing **String: a**

__5) Briefly describe a scenario in which you may get full control over a system due to this
vulnerability__

### Exercise 6: Buffer overflows - A more realistic exploit

### Exercise 7: Integer Overflow

__1) Explain why you are able to crash the program and what type of error you encountered.__

- Program expects two arguments arugment1 is passed to `atoi`  and typecasted to short and stored in s.
- size of buffer is 
-  
__2) Briefly explain the input you used to crash the program.__

![img](../task4/images/7_2.JPG)
![img](../task4/images/7_2.1.JPG)

__3) Correct the code to avoid this vulnerability. Deliver the corrected code!__
- Declare variable s as int 
![img](../task4/images/7_4.JPG)


### Exercise 8: Format string functionality

__1) Roughly outline the stack structure ( position in and allocated size on the stack for all arguments to printf )__

- # **to do**

__2) Use a short sample program and gdb to verify your answers from the last subtask. Deliver a
gdb-printout of the stack ( and your sample program of course ) in which you can identify
and explain the relevant parts and positions of the arguments.__
- Sample program
 ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(){
   char *somestring = "Some characters";
   printf("An integer:%d,Guess:%f,Some string:%s\n",3141,3.141,somestring);
  }
 ```
- The main stack frame consits of somestring.

![img](../task4/images/8_2.png)
__3) Use the last two subtasks to explain the behavior of the given code when you omit the
argument somestring. If possible verify your results with the printf function of gdb.__
